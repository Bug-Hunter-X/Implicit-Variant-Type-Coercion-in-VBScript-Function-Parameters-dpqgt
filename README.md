This example demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript: implicit type coercion of function parameters.  VBScript, by default, treats function parameters as Variants. This can result in unexpected behavior, especially when performing arithmetic or comparisons. Explicitly declaring parameter types improves code clarity, prevents errors, and enhances maintainability.
